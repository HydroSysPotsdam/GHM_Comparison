Poetry is used for dependency management. `pyproject.toml` specifies the dependencies needed to run the code.

To create a virtual environemnt to reproduce this code, run `poetry install`. This will install the dependencies in a new vitrualenv and you can now run scripts with `poetry run python your_script.py`.
