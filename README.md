# Code used for the paper "Functional relationships reveal differences in the water cycle representation of global water models"

The repository contains:
- code to aggregate model inputs and outputs and to obtain multi-annual averages for a certain time period,
- code to visualize model outputs (e.g. as maps),
- code to visualize and quantify functional relationships between model forcing and response variables (scatter plots, rank correlations),
- code to visualize and quantify functional relationships based on observational datasets (scatter plots, rank correlations),
- code with additional checks (e.g. different model forcings for certain models).

The long-term averages created and used in this study are deposited at https://zenodo.org/record/7714885. 
Correlations and other statistics are available in the Supporting Information. 
Links to the data sources can be found in the paper.
